Thanks for checking out @TheAlexandriaCohort's repository! Our mission is to refactor as much of the world's information as possible 
into intuitive, accessible innovations for the benefit of all. So, naturally, you'll find many of our projects here on GitHub! 

We're looking forward to seeing what can happen when information is reimagined.
